2. Select the difficulty level from the dropdown menu.
3. Click the "Start Playing" button to begin the game.
4. Type the words displayed on the screen as quickly and accurately as possible.
5. The game will provide feedback on your performance and offer an option to play again.

## what-i-learned
- **HTML**: Structuring a web page with semantic elements and ensuring proper use of meta tags.
- **CSS**: Styling the game interface using CSS variables, flexbox for layout management, and ensuring responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Implementing game logic, handling DOM manipulation, and using event listeners effectively.

## Continued Development
Future improvements and features I plan to add:
- **Additional Levels**: Introduce more difficulty levels or custom levels where users can set their own time limits and word lists.
- **Word Lists**: Expand the word list to include more words or allow users to upload their own word lists.
- **Leaderboard**: Implement a leaderboard to track high scores and allow users to compete with friends.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure the game is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Add more accessibility features such as keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- **Themes**: Allow users to choose different themes or color schemes for the game interface.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Introduce a multiplayer mode where users can compete against each other in real-time.
